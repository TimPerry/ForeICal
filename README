ForeICal uses two classes ForeICal and ForeICalEvent to create a ics calendar file and serve it to the user for download. The script must not be on a page where you want content to be displayed, as the headers that are used to generate the calendar file will use what ever content is outputted on the page to create the ics calendar file.

Example usage:

// require the calendar class
require('ForeICal.class.php');

// create an instance of the calendar, usage (<calendar_name>, <filename> (must end in .ics))
$cal = new ForeICal('Tims Cal', 'tims_cal.ics');

// add an event, usage (<event_name>, <start_time> e.g. (01-01-2012), <end_time> e.g. ('01-01-2012'), <summary> (if blank summary=event_name, <location>)
$cal->addEvent(new ForeICalEvent('new events', '01-04-2012', '01-04-2012'));

// finally output the calendar
$cal->output();


The code above is also saved into the example.php page
